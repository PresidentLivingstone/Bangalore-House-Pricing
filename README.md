# Bangalore House Pricing Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It implements a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on features like location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The project demonstrates the data science workflow, from preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model evaluation and deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset contains details about house properties in Bangalore, including:
- **Location**: The neighborhood or area where the house is located.
- **Size**: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- **Total Square Feet**: Total area of the house.
- **Price**: The target variable indicating the price of the house.
- **Other Features**: Additional features like availability, built year, etc.

Dataset Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Import the dataset and understand its structure.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze distributions, correlations, and outliers.
   - Visualize price trends based on location, size, and other features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and duplicate entries.
   - Encode categorical features like `location`.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features to improve model performance, such as price per square foot.

5. **Model Building**:
   - Experiment with algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   - Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate performance using metrics such as RMSE, R^2, and MAE.
   - Compare models to select the best one.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Develop a Flask or Streamlit web application for users to predict house prices by entering property details.

## Key Features

- Predicts house prices based on input features.
- Provides insights into Bangalore's real estate market.
- User-friendly interface for price prediction (if deployed).
